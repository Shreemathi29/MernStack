Construct a python program that accepts the items of tuples 
containing the category as the first entry and different components of the category
 along with their costs as the following entries. The job is to create a tuple which
 summarizes the costs for each category. [CO1] [L2]
Sample workout as given below:


Input:
2     //No of tuples
7     //No of items in 1st tuple
Education    //Items  in the 1st tuple  Category
Primary     // Component
50              //Cost
Secondary
25
Higher
20
7            //No of items in 2nd tuple
Defense      //Items in the 2nd tuple     Category
Army        //Component
25             //Cost
AirForce
40
Navy
45
 
Output:
((Education, 95), (Defense, 110))
Pseudo Code:
1) Input the number of categories, referred by variable n
2) Initialize list t, i.e t=[]
3) Run a for loop in the range n( 0 to n-1 ):
3.1) Input the number of components, referred by variable m
3.2) Input the category name. Let s refer to it.
3.3)Assign cost with value 0
3.4)Run a for loop in range of (m-1)//2 (0 to (m-1)//2) :
3.4.1) Input component name
3.4.2)Input component price
3.4.3) Increment cost by component price
3.5) Create a tuple with the two elements as component name and cost
3.6) Append this tuple to list t
4) Display t








Construct a python program to read the three subjects

 marks secured by n students during the FAT examination. 
If a student secured less than 50 in any subject, the student is 
failed in that subject. Count the number of students who failed in 
each subject and the total
 number of students who failed in at least one subject
